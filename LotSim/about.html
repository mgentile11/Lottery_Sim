    <ul>
      <li class="listSpacing">This is a Lottery simulator based off of the Lottery system that was designed for
      the drawing of tickets for the play Hamilton, this past year.</li>
      <li class="listSpacing">The winner is drawn by randomly selecting a number that would match with the id placed on 
      your ticket.</li>
      <ul>
          <li class="listSpacing">To save time, I just used the number 1 as the winning ticket everytime. To make this
          simulation more realistic, I should have the ticket number be some random generated number between 1 and the 
          amount of people buying tickets, but my method does the same thing, more or less. Don't really worry about all that for now.</li>
      </ul>
      <li class="listSpacing">The number of winning tickets remains constant, but one parameter that can change each time a new set of 
      tickets are issued, is number of people</li>
      <ul>
        <li class="listSpacing">
          This number changes so please mess around and change the number. I think it should currenlty be 50000.
          Just click on the number and you should be able to change it. (Notice how some of the other numbers change.)
        </li>

        It should be failry intuitive, but hopefully all of these notes and instructions help.
